<h1>Getting Big Money Out of Politics: A Plan for Fair and Transparent Elections</h1>

<h2>The Facts: Democracy is for Sale</h2>

<p>Money has overtaken American democracy, drowning out the voices of everyday citizens in favor of wealthy individuals, corporations, and special interest groups. The influence of mega-donors and dark money in our elections has created a system where those with the deepest pockets have the loudest voices, leaving the average voter with little say in the policies that shape our country.</p>

<h3>The Scope of the Problem</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Historic Election Spending:</strong> The 2024 election cycle was the most expensive in U.S. history, with a staggering <strong>$15.9 billion spent</strong> across all races.</li>
  <li><strong>The Candidate with the Most Money Wins:</strong> In 2018, <strong>89% of House races</strong> and <strong>84% of Senate races</strong> were won by the candidate with the most money.</li>
  <li><strong>Super PACs and Dark Money:</strong> Super PACs raised <strong>$4.29 billion</strong> in 2024. Dark money groups spent nearly <strong>$1 billion</strong> in federal elections between 2010 and 2020.</li>
  <li><strong>Billionaire Influence:</strong> In 2024, 150 billionaire families contributed nearly <strong>$1.9 billion</strong> to political campaigns.</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate Interests at Play:</strong> Companies like Wells Fargo and United Health Care pumped millions into Super PACs and lobbying efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate Lobbying is Out of Control:</strong> In 2024, Big Oil alone spent <strong>$243 million</strong> lobbying Congress.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Trust is at an All-Time Low:</strong> Voter confidence has plummeted as the system increasingly favors wealth over the public good.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Solution: Publicly Funded Elections, Ending Corporate Influence, and Banning Insider Trading</h2>

<p><strong>Corporations and billionaires wouldn’t be spending billions of dollars on campaigns and lobbying if they weren’t seeing a return on their investment.</strong> Every dollar spent is meant to buy influence, shape policy, and ensure favorable legislation. This system has turned our democracy into a marketplace where access and decision-making are for sale to the highest bidder. Our solution aims to end this pay-to-play system and return power to the people.</p>

<p>We believe that elections should be decided by the <strong>people</strong>, not by the highest bidder. Our plan is simple: remove corporate influence, eliminate mega-donors, dismantle corporate lobbying power, and make all political campaigns <strong>publicly funded and fully transparent</strong>.</p>

<h3>Our Goals:</h3>

      <li>Require blind trusts to eliminate conflicts of interest.</li>
      <li>Enforce strong penalties for violations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ban Corporate and Special Interest Donations</strong>

      <li>Impose strong penalties for concealment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Establish Publicly Funded Elections</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a public election fund for qualified candidates.</li>
      <li>Match small-dollar donations with public funds.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ban Stock Trading for Elected Officials and High-Level Government Officials</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Public servants should not personally benefit from insider access to market-sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Amend the Constitution to End Corporate Influence in Politics</strong>
    <ul>

      <li>Clarify that corporations are not people and money is not speech.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>A Democracy That Works for Everyone</h2>

<p>This is not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue. The current system benefits only the ultra-wealthy while the rest of us are left without a voice in the decisions that affect our lives. By eliminating the influence of mega-donors, dismantling corporate lobbying power, and implementing publicly funded elections, we can restore democracy to <strong>the people</strong>.</p>

<p>It's time to take our government back. <strong>No more billionaires buying elections. No more dark money. No more corporate influence.</strong> Just free, fair, and transparent elections where every citizen’s voice matters equally.</p>

<h3>Join the Movement</h3>

<p>If you believe in a democracy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy elite, join us in fighting for publicly funded elections and lobbying reform. <strong>Sign the petition, spread the word, and demand real campaign finance reform today.</strong></p>
