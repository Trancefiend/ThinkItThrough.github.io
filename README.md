# Science-Based Political Platform

Welcome to the official site for our evidence-driven political platform. This project is built on a simple principle: **policy should be grounded in facts, not ideology**. We aim to tackle society's biggest challenges using science, data, and reason.

## 📚 About the Platform

Our political platform focuses on:

- **Education reform** to boost critical thinking and science literacy.
- A **public healthcare option** grounded in cost-effectiveness and health outcomes.
- **Green policies** to address climate change and invest in clean energy.
- **Ending homelessness and food insecurity** through practical, scalable programs.
- **Getting big money out of politics** and restoring public accountability.

We believe the best policies come from testing ideas, measuring impact, and adjusting based on what works — not partisan loyalty.
